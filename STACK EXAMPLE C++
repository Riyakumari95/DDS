C++ is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. It's an object-oriented language that extends the C language, offering features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. C++ is widely used in system programming, game development, high-performance applications, and more. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ is an object-oriented language, meaning it organizes code into reusable "objects" that contain data and methods (functions) that operate on that data. This promotes modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of large codebases. 
Extension of C:C++ was designed as an extension of the C language, inheriting its syntax and low-level control capabilities. This allows developers to work with hardware and system resources efficiently. 
Performance:C++ is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for performance-critical applications where speed is paramount. 
Versatile:C++ is used in a wide range of applications, including: 
Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux kernels rely on C++. 
Game Development: Many popular games are built using C++. 
Real-Time Systems: C++ is well-suited for applications requiring fast response times. 
High-Frequency Trading: C++ is used in financial applications where speed is crucial. 
Embedded Systems: C++ can be used to develop software for devices like smartphones, cars, and other embedded systems. 

EXAMPLE :-

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define size 5
int stack [size];
int top=-1;
void push (int val) {
if(top<size-1) {
top++;
stack [top]=val;
cout<<val<<"inserted successfully"<<endl;
}
else{
cout<<"stack is overflow"<<endl;
}}
int main(){
push(10);
push (2);
push(5);
push(8);
push(10);
push(28);
return 0;
}
